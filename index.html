            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education policy is prepared by the Central Government and State
                Governments at national and state levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has
                provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional
                elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system.[39] A significant feature of India's
                secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the
                society.[citation needed] Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in
                vocational training. Another feature of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession
                based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing.[40]
                A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the
                Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.[41] Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) which is the most
                recent initiative of Government of India to achieve the goal of universalisation of secondary education
                (USE). It is aimed at expanding and improving the standards of secondary education up to class X.[42].

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a 'concurrent subject'. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education. In a country as large as India, now with 28
                states and eight union territories, this means that the potential for variations between states in the
                policies, plans, programs and initiatives for elementary education is vast. Periodically, national
                policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation of state-level programs and policies.
                State governments and local government bodies manage the majority of primary and upper primary schools
                and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing. Simultaneously the number and
                proportion managed by private bodies is growing. In 2005-6 83.13% of schools offering elementary
                education (Grades 1–8) were managed by government and 16.86% of schools were under private management
                (excluding children in unrecognised schools, schools established under the Education Guarantee Scheme
                and in alternative learning centers). Of those schools managed privately, one third are 'aided' and two
                thirds are 'unaided'. Enrolment in Grades 1–8 is shared between government and privately managed schools
                in the ratio 73:27. However in rural areas this ratio is higher (80:20) and in urban areas much lower

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is a Concurrent List subject, that is both the Indian
                central government, and the state governments have responsibility for enacting and implementing
                education policy.[34] The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the "10+2" pattern
                of education.[35]: 3  In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior
                colleges (Maharashtra) or Higher Secondary Schools(most other states),[35]: 44  and then 3 years of
                study for a bachelor's degree.[36] The first 10 years is further subdivided into 8 years of elementary
                education (5 years Primary School and 3 years Middle School), 2 years of Secondary education followed by
                2 years of Higher Secondary Schools or Junior colleges.[35]: 5  This pattern originated from the
                recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964–66.[37]

                There are two types of educational institutions in India, 1) Recognized institutions – primary school,
                secondary school, special schools, intermediate schools, colleges and universities who follow courses as
                prescribed by universities or boards and are also open for inspection by these authorities , 2)
                Unrecognized Institutions, which do not fulfill conditions as stated for the recognized ones</p>
